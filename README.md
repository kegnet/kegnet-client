# KegNet Client #

The KegNet client consists of a small, cheap, internet connected computer 
attached to a liquid flow meter and a temperature sensor. This allows it to 
constantly track beer consumption and refrigerator temperature, which is then 
transmitted to the central KegNet servers for processing and display.

For more information please see the [KegNet Wiki](https://github.com/kegnet/kegnet-client/wiki).
